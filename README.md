# Genetic-algorithm

The genetic algorithm performs the overlapping of two triangles in 3D space. 

In the initial state, there are two triangles with random positions in 3D space. 

The genetic algorithm must find the positions of these two triangles such that, in the final state, triangle_1 must overlap triangle_2 and they must be parallel to each other as well.
